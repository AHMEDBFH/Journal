            In the first week of my bootcamp we did the basic of
            <strong>J</strong>avascript, difference between values and variable,
            data types, basic operators. The one that was a bit challenge for me
            was learning functions, to get the concept i watched some youtube
            videos did some exercises on codewars and i rewatched the class
            recordings, just to understand how it works and when to use them.
            What i gained only in this first week was amazing, on codewars i
            started the 8kyu and completed that level, now am on 7kyu which is a
            big achievement for me!

            This week was amazing, i learnet the basics <strong>H</strong>tml
            and <strong>C</strong>ss. The Html i mastered almost everything
            about it within that week, i did create many small projects and
            cloned some websites. The Css we didn't cover alot we did some basic
            styling, giving colors to the html elements, changing the
            font-sizes, adding heights and width and research on more css
            properties and their use cases. We also learned about
            <strong>D</strong>atabase, it was fantastic, i loved every bit of it
            and i have finished alot of SQL exercises on
            <strong>W</strong>3school

            However my life extends beyond the sports arena. In my free moments,
            i seek mental stimulation through puzzles. Soduku with its logical
            challenges, the satisfaction i get from solving each puzzle mirrors
            the joy i experience on the ground, creating a harmonious balance in
            my life

            developer and to achieve that goal i enrolled myself a software
            development bootcamp course, so far am in the 2nd week of the
            course, doing really well, each day after the class i set aside two
            hours of research and watching back i learnt that day, really
